# Networking-Fundamentals
This repository provides an overview of the fundamentals of computer networking. After completing Adrian Cantrill's Networking Fundamentals course, I created a brief summary of each layer of the OSI Model, along with questions to reinforce key concepts. 

## Layer 1 Physical 
The Physical Layer is the first layer of the OSI model, and it’s all about how data is physically transmitted and received over a network. This layer sets the hardware standards like voltage levels, timing, data rates, distances, and connectors.

### Questions
1. **What is Layer 1 in networking?**

- Layer 1 is the Physical Layer in networking, which involves transmitting and receiving raw bit streams between a device and a shared physical medium.

2.  **What are the types of physical mediums used in Layer 1?**

- The physical mediums used in Layer 1 can be copper (electrical), fiber (light), or Wi-Fi (radio frequency).

3. **What is a hub in the context of Layer 1 networking?**

- A hub is a device that retransmits anything it receives on any of its ports to all other ports, including errors or collisions. It creates a shared medium for all connected devices.

4. **What are some limitations of Layer 1?**

- Some limitations of Layer 1 include:

1. No individual device addresses.
2. Unable to detect collisions.
3. No media access control.
4. No intelligence or methods to control transmission.

5. **What happens when a collision occurs in Layer 1?**

 - When a collision occurs in Layer 1, multiple devices transmit simultaneously, making all the transmitted information useless. Layer 1 can't detect collisions.

6. **Why is Layer 2 necessary for Layer 1 to be useful?**

 - Layer 2, the Data Link Layer, is necessary because Layer 1 lacks device addresses, collision detection, media access control, and intelligent communication methods.

 ## Layer 2 Data

The Data Link Layer, or Layer 2, is critical in the OSI model as it facilitates device-to-device communication and supports data transfer over the internet. It relies on a functional Layer 1 network and can operate over various physical mediums like copper, fiber, and WiFi. Layer 2 introduces frames for data transmission and unique MAC addresses for device identification. It works with Layer 1 to transmit frames as physical signals and includes error-checking mechanisms to ensure data integrity. Frames are generated by Layer 2, sent over the medium, and received and processed at the destination before being handed to Layer 3.

### Questions

1. **What is the main function of the Data Link Layer?**
   - To provide device-to-device communication by organizing data into frames for transmission over a network and ensuring reliable data transfer.

2. **How does the Data Link Layer support data transfer to/from the internet?**
   - By framing the data, adding necessary MAC addresses, and ensuring the data is transmitted and received correctly over the physical medium.

3. **What is an Ethernet frame, and what is its purpose?**
   - A structured format for sending information over a Layer 2 network. Its purpose is to encapsulate data, add addressing and error-checking information, and ensure the data is correctly transmitted and received over the network.

4. **What is a MAC address, and why is it important?**
   - Unique hardware address assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) that identifies a device on a network. It is important because it ensures data is sent to the correct destination device.

5. **How do Layer 2 and Layer 1 work together to transmit data?**
   - Layer 2 organizes data into frames and adds necessary addressing and error-checking information. It then passes these frames to Layer 1, which converts the frames into signals (electrical, light, or radio frequency) for transmission over the physical medium.

6. **What are the different components of a Layer 2 frame?**
   - Preamble and start frame delimiter, destination MAC address, source MAC address, EtherType (ET), payload (data), and Frame Check Sequence (FCS).

7. **What is the Frame Check Sequence (FCS), and why is it important?**
   - Field in the frame used for error-checking. It allows the receiving device to detect if any corruption occurred during transmission and ensures data integrity.
